This is a bundle I have made for Nodecg that runs my streams currently. This uses various HTML files and basic Nodecg set up on a local PC to run. I currently have it limited in comments but hope to be adding a lot more pretty soon. I anticipate that this is going to be an ongoing/everchanging project that I will continue to update or post new versions of.
